Quantity of the filling totally depends on you.\nApplying oil over the baked samosas is optional, but it does give a good colour to the samosas.\n\nTips:\nYou can store the samosas in a container for about a month.\n", "title": "Mini Samosa Recipe \u2013 Moong Dal Namkeen Baked Samosas \u2013 CookingShooking", "publish": true, "cookTime": "30 mins", "youtubeUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/H-TOsuvRDaw?autoplay=1"}
