I personally like the thick paste with specks which hand blender makes well :)<br/>Tips on the Green Color : Adding something acidic helps, like curd or lemon.. Curd is in the recipe which gives a good taste and helps. Do not Cover the pan at all, always cook in open pan.<br/>I prefer to just chop the spinach and use.. If you wish, you can blanch the spinach, then chop and then add.. But I prefer this way. If blanching is your thing, you can add a pinch of baking soda in the water.. it will make sure its greener!<br/>\u00bd tsp Slightly Broiled and Hand Crushed Dry Kasoori Methi/Fenugreek can be added in the end.<br/>If you wish, you can fry the paneer. Or add about \u00bd tsp oil in a pan, add the paneer and kind of shallow fry them then add the paste..<br/>If you want strands of onions in the end result, you can chop 1 more onion into Half Moons and then kind of open them.. Then take \u00bd tsp oil in a pan and then add the onions cook for a minute then add the puree.. The place I had palak paneer had such onion strands..

It's Fresh Peas, Spinach, Sarson ka Saag, Strawberrys, and more.. So, recently on a trip, We were running out of time for the return so we hopped into a dhaba kind restaurant and quickly said Palak Paneer and naans.. My god, the hunger and how we(Me and Dad) finished the whole plate of Palak Paneer and Naans! And the taste was out-stannddiiinggg! And believe me, I had never liked palak paneer earlier..<br /><br /><a href=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F02%2Fpalakpaneerrsdsir1.jpg?alt=media\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2292 aligncenter\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F02%2Fpalakpaneerrsdsir1.jpg?alt=media\" alt=\"palakpaneerrsdsir1\" width=\"619\" height=\"1080\" /></a><br /><br />So, as the winters were here, I thought to make some at home, Umm.. It was good but not like, then kept trying other ways.. Sometimes loads of garlic, sometimes extremely acidic,\u00a0sometimes with some thickener, sometimes.. And went on, Unless i thought to avoid the blanching and make the gravy in one go like make the masala and add spinach and puree.. And breezee, it was awesome, and better than the dhaba :D :D :D<br /><br /><a href=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F02%2Fpalakpaneerrsdsir4.jpg?alt=media\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2295\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F02%2Fpalakpaneerrsdsir4.jpg?alt=media\" alt=\"palakpaneerrsdsir4\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /></a><br /><br />Look, look at that!
