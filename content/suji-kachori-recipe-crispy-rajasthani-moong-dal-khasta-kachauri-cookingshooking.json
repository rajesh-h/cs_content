We are talking about Kachori commonly known as Khasta Kachauri. Kachori\u2019s are deep fried crispy and crunchy pastry balls stuffed with a savoury filling of moong dal, besan and a mild sweet and spicy dry masala. This recipe is unique in its own way, the outer covering is not made using maida rather its made with suji or semolina, which is a much healthier option. The most important part of the recipe is to ensure that the kachoris turn crispy from outside and super soft and moist from inside. Let\u2019s get to it."}], "recipeNotes": "Notes:\nBesan is a key ingredient, do not skip it.\nSugar will balance out the flavors. Use as required.\nFilling shape needs to be flat or else you make have difficulty stuffing it.\nKachori size depends on the size of you filling.\n", "searchTags": ["halwai style dal kachori", "khasta kachori recipe", "moong dal kachori recipe", "rajasthani khasta kachori", "sooji kachori"], "title": "Suji Kachori Recipe \u2013 Crispy Rajasthani Moong Dal Khasta Kachauri \u2013 CookingShooking", "cookTime": "30 mins", "publish": true, "youtubeUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ZHjXN0u3bc?autoplay=1", "id": 8202, "recipeSteps": [{"group": {"name": "For the filling", "steps": [{"stepImageUrl": "https://cookingshooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Step-1-15-300x165.jpg", "text": "In a bowl soak the moong dal in water for 1 hour.
