Go and get one, why because its awesome! Ohk, let me explain a tit bit of the setup i was talking about in the video.<br /><br />Basically, you keep a perforated plate over the flame(Heavy Duty one!) then comes the coal. Then keep a grill stand and above that the tawa. Then cover this with a big kadhai/pan which is actually very big and if using a kadhai, use the one which has no handles, something like <a href=\"https://www.google.co.in/search?q=dekchi&amp;espv=2&amp;tbm=isch&amp;imgil=uJEQ_Cux-ZN7TM%253A%253Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fencrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com%252Fimages%253Fq%253Dtbn%253AANd9GcTuFD6ymiAtPoMYGDzwehxCdhbm2fHamKnRswud7L3gugNH47UQ%253B4608%253B2592%253BP6QYXRUsZyJU9M%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fcommons.wikimedia.org%25252Fwiki%25252FFile%25253AKadai_and_a_dekchi.JPG&amp;source=iu&amp;usg=__m-kctJOySyfBr6jHu0XM2oEYEcw%3D&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eJKqU5DVE82cugS7noCwBA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CB0Q9QEwAA&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=912#facrc=_&amp;imgrc=uJEQ_Cux-ZN7TM%253A%3BP6QYXRUsZyJU9M%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fupload.wikimedia.org%252Fwikipedia%252Fcommons%252F0%252F0b%252FKadai_and_a_dekchi.JPG%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fcommons.wikimedia.org%252Fwiki%252FFile%253AKadai_and_a_dekchi.JPG%3B4608%3B2592\">this</a>. It should cover everything. Yes, a bit confusing.. So, on my take, almost everyone has a gas tandoor or a microwave with convection, bake in that as this way is a bit confusing.. All the best! :)<br /><br />Believe me or not, this bread was so awesome that we ate two loaves in a day! YES! We're not a bread fan, but there's something awesome in homemade breads! Go and bake <del>one</del>\u00a0a couple for you! :)<br /><br />Thanks for stopping by,<br /><p style=\"color: #777777;\">CookingShooking is on\u00a0<a style=\"color: #428bca;\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/CookingShooking\">YouTube</a>,\u00a0<a style=\"color: #428bca;\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/CookingShooking\">Facebook</a>,\u00a0<a style=\"color: #428bca;\" href=\"https://cookingshooking.com/cabbage-sambharo/www.Google.com/+CookingshookingIn\">Google+</a>,\u00a0<a style=\"color: #428bca;\" href=\"http://twitter.com/CookingShooking\">Twitter</a>!</p>", "updated": 1433597130000, "serves": "N/A", "slug": "brownbreadebwo", "author": "Yaman Agarwal", "recipeIngredients": [{"group": {"name": "", "ingredients": [{"quantity": "2 {finely chopped}", "ingredient": "Onion"}, {"quantity": "1/4 cup", "ingredient": "Coconut"}, {"quantity": "1/4 cup {roughly diced}", "ingredient": "Potato"}, {"quantity": "1/4 cup {roughly diced}", "ingredient": "Carrots"}, {"quantity": "1/4 cup {small florets}", "ingredient": "Cauliflower"}, {"ingredient": "Beans", "quantity": "1/4 cup {chopped}"}, {"quantity": "50g {cubes}", "ingredient": "Paneer"}, {"ingredient": "Oil", "quantity": "2 tbsp + as required to shallow fry veggies"}, {"quantity": "1/2 tsp", "ingredient": "Cumin Seeds"}, {"quantity": "1/4 tsp", "ingredient": "Asafoetida"}, {"quantity": "4-5", "ingredient": "Curry Leaves"}, {"quantity": "2 {slit}", "ingredient": "Green Chilis"}, {"ingredient": "Dry Red Chilis", "quantity": "3 + 1"}, {"ingredient": "Bay Leaf", "quantity": "2"}, {"ingredient": "Ginger Garlic Paste", "quantity": "1/2 tbsp"}, {"quantity": "6 Medium", "ingredient": "Blended Tomatoes"}, {"quantity": "as per taste", "ingredient": "Salt"}, {"quantity": "1 tsp", "ingredient": "Kashmiri Red Chili Powder"}, {"quantity": "1/4 tsp", "ingredient": "Black Pepper"}, {"quantity": "1 tsp", "ingredient": "Amchoor Powder"}, {"quantity": "1 tsp", "ingredient": "Garam Masala"}, {"quantity": "1 tsp", "ingredient": "Sambhar Masala"}, {"quantity": "1/4 tsp", "ingredient": "Sugar"}, {"ingredient": "Coriander", "quantity": "handful [chopped]"}, {"ingredient": "Corn Flour", "quantity": "1/2 tsp"}, {"ingredient": "Capsicum", "quantity": "1/4 cup {roughly diced}"}, {"quantity": "3 tbsp", "ingredient": "Coconut Milk"}, {"quantity": "1 tsp", "ingredient": "Tadka Garnish : Oil"}, {"quantity": "1/2 tsp", "ingredient": "Mustard Seeds"}, {"ingredient": "Split Bengal Gram / Chana Dal- 1/2 tsp", "quantity": "N/A"}, {"quantity": "N/A", "ingredient": "Split Skinless Black Gram / Dhuli Urad Dal- 1/2 tsp"}, {"quantity": "2-3", "ingredient": "Curry Leaves"}, {"ingredient": "Dry Red Chili", "quantity": "1"}, {"quantity": "1 tsp {finely chopped}", "ingredient": "Coriander"}]}}], "featuredImage": "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2014%2F06%2FBrownbread42.jpg?alt=media"}
