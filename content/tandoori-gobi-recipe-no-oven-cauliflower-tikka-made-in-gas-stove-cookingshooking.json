So we just decided to give it our own version of tandoor cooking. Today\u2019s recipe is just, that making tandoor cooking easy. Tandoori Gobi is just one of the few dishes that are apt for all veggie food lovers. Pieces of gobi florets marinated in a thick yogurt and mildly spiced marinade. Smoked for 30 minutes with the help of hot burning charcoal and ghee, until the smoky flavor and aroma is captured in the Gobi and then delicately skewered and cooked over direct heat until lightly charred and cooked. Tandoori Gobi is a popular Indian appetizer and every piece is full of flavor, delicious and mouthwatering."}], "recipeNotes": "Notes:\nAdding vinegar will disinfect the cauliflower florets.\nIn the marinade you can reduce the lemon juice incase the dahi is sour.\nYou can cook the tandoori gobi in advance, and then cook it once again before serving.\nYou need to cook the tandoori gobi over high flame, cooking it over low flame will dry out the gobi and remove all the moisture.\n\nTips:\nPlease retain the stalks of the florets. Long stalks will ensure that the cauliflower florets are easily cooked.\nWooden skewers are not reusable and cannot take the weight of the gobi. Recommend to use metal skewers they are sturdy and stable to use.\nPlace a piece of foil around the gas burner; this will avoid the area from becoming messy and there is no spillage.\n", "searchTags": ["easy tandoori gobi recipe", "how to make tandoori gobi", "tandoori gobi recipe", "tandoori recipe without oven"], "title": "Tandoori Gobi Recipe \u2013 No Oven | Cauliflower Tikka Made in Gas Stove \u2013 CookingShooking", "cookTime": "30 mins", "publish": true, "youtubeUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/9a4_1JMxQeE?autoplay=1", "id": 8964, "recipeSteps": [{"group": {"name": "For the florets", "steps": [{"text": "In a large saucepan or kadhai, pour water and bring it to a boil.
