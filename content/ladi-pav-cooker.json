But can get tricky when making without oven. Here are a few points for you to look at:<br/>-&gt; The size and the height of the tin matters. Make sure the height of the cake tin is no more than 2\". You want the pavs when prooved to be parallel or above the tin's height for them to brown well inside the cooker.<br/>-&gt; Flame : The flame that we use to bake cakes is low-med quite on the low side. But for baking these pav, you need to have the flame in med-high. Quite on the higher side. <br/>-&gt; Browning : A good brushing of milk is usually enough for it. But, But, if you are not confident whether they will brown well or not, you can add a pinch of sugar and mix the sugar in the milk and then brush the pavs. The sugar will help in browning much better. But be careful, too much sugar can lead to over-browning/burning. Just a pinch is good.<br/>-&gt; Make sure to remove the gasket/rubber thing of your pressure cooker. <br/>-&gt; As the heat is going to be quite on the higher side, be careful. And i will suggest to use old salt. I mean, use salt that you have used earlier to bake something else.<br/>-&gt;", "title": "Eggless Ladi Pav Without Oven - Feather Soft Buns Recipe In Cooker - Eggless Baking Without Oven", "publish": true, "cookTime": "N/A", "youtubeUrl": "www.youtube.com/embed/sD_gDptMnY8", "recipeSteps": [{"group": {"name": "", "steps": [{"text": "To the warm milk, add the sugar and the yeast.
