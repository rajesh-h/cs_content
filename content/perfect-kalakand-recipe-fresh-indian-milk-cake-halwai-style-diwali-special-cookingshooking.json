Let\u2019s begin the New Year with some traditional mouth-watering Indian Desserts. Today\u2019s recipe is of \u00a0exquisitely beautiful and milky\u00a0sweet dish that\u00a0is made out of solidifying, milk to paneer, thicken with citric acid and sweetening it with sugar and slight flavoring with hint of cardamom. The trick to get the perfect kalakand is by continuously stirring and cooking all the ingredients until reduced considerably, then setting it up in a pan for twenty four hours..yes patience is virtue, but the reward is utterly sinful and delightful. So have a blast and go all out this Diwali!", "imageUrl": "https://storage.googleapis.com/cscom-2019.appspot.com/uploads/2018/11/kalakand.jpg"}], "recipeNotes": "Notes:\nStirring the milk continuously is very important; if you burn the milk then the whole kalakand will not be edible to eat.\nKeep stirring and scrap the sides of the kadhai so that you avoid the milk from sticking or burning at the bottom of the pan.\nUsing the citric acid all at once will ruin the kalakand and will make it chewy in texture.\nAdding the sugar all at once will separate the milk and the milk and the curdle solids will be chewy.\n\nTips:\nUse full cream milk for this recipe for an absolute perfect kalakand.\nClean the iron kadhai with citric acid, and ensure that there is no oil in the kadhai.\nKalakand is always served unshaped, because it takes long to set.\nWe cannot keep the kalakand in the fridge to set. It will change the taste and texture. Allow the kalakand to set naturally for atleast 24 hours.\n", "searchTags": ["diwali sweet recipes", "how to make kalakand", "indian milk cake recipe", "indian sweets", "kalakand milk barfi recipe", "kalakand using milk"], "title": "Perfect Kalakand Recipe \u2013 Fresh Indian Milk Cake Halwai Style Diwali Special \u2013 CookingShooking", "cookTime": "45 mins", "publish": true, "youtubeUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/q3DM9LyShmM?autoplay=1", "id": 8585, "recipeSteps": [{"group": {"steps": [{"text": "Preheat a deep iron kadhai over high heat, pour the milk.", "stepImageUrl": "https://cookingshooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Step-1-1-300x153.jpg"}, {"text": "Over high heat, bring the milk to a boil and continuously stir the milk.", "stepImageUrl": "https://cookingshooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Step-2-300x147.jpg"}, {"text": "In a small bowl combine the citric acid with water.
