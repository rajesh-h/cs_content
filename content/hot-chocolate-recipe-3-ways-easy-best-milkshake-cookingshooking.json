It\u2019s no rocket science the reason is we\u2019ll teach you how to make it from scratch with minimal fuss and simple ingredients and overly simple method. Melted chocolate in warm milk served with whipped cream and sprinkled with more chocolate, sounds heavenly. So let\u2019s make it and keep ourselves warm during the cold winter night."}], "recipeNotes": "Notes:\nGrated chocolate will give a nice silky smooth texture to the hot chocolate.\nAdjust the grated chocolate quantity as per your preference.\nQuantity of chocolate in the third method, is completely upto you. Just remember, more chocolate will make it creamier and thicker and less chocolate which will give you airiness and lightness to the hot chocolate.\n\nTips:\nPlease use cold milk for the second variety, as the cold milk will increase in volume when you warm it in the microwave.\nPlease remove the small spout of the blender; this will prevent the blender from bursting, as the milk is hot.\nIf using a steamer, the milk will not gather air bubbles or increase in volume, because of the high quantity of the grated chocolate, but it will make the hot chocolate creamier. And if you use less chocolate then it will double in volume but not be as delicious.\n", "searchTags": ["3 ways hot chocolate", "drinks recipe compilation", "hot chocolate from scratch", "hot chocolate milkshake"], "title": "Hot Chocolate Recipe \u2013 3 Ways Easy & Best Milkshake \u2013 CookingShooking", "cookTime": "10 mins", "publish": true, "youtubeUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSlkojZ0Hjk?autoplay=1", "id": 7547, "recipeSteps": [{"group": {"name": "For the first method \u2013 over the gas", "steps": [{"text": "In a serving cup pour cold milk, little below the rim of the glass, about 150 ml per serving.", "stepImageUrl": "https://cookingshooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Step-1-7-300x250.jpg"}, {"text": "Pour the milk in a sauce pan and bring it to a boil.
