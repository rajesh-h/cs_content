This is ought to be my favorite Indian Sweets.. I've failed, over 30 times to prepare this, Sigh! Just for you all.. Finally, after 4 months from my first try.. Here, I have the perfect recipe for you all!!<br /><br /><a href=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2013%2F10%2FRasgulla1.jpg?alt=media\"><img class=\"wp-image-699 aligncenter\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2013%2F10%2FRasgulla1.jpg?alt=media\" alt=\"Rasgulla\" width=\"717\" height=\"403\" /></a><br /><br />I would suggest, watch the video and see the consistency of the chenna to get the perfect rasgullas.. If the chenna is over kneaded, it wont work, if its less kneaded, it wont workout! So, see and consistency and prepare this... The key to get a perfect rasgulla is lying on the moisture content and the kneading.. Many recipes mention to knead for so and so minutes.. But the time depends upon the quality of chenna.. As i mentioned in the video..<br /><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2013%2F10%2FRasgulla-2.jpg?alt=media\"><img class=\"wp-image-696 aligncenter\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2013%2F10%2FRasgulla-2.jpg?alt=media\" alt=\"Rasgulla 2\" width=\"684\" height=\"385\" /></a></p><br /><p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p><br /><br /><br /></div><br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />I love it the next day, but my craving does not let it stay it for that long.. They get finished as soon as they are cooled.. Feel free to ask me any queries about this.. I have the solution of this rasgulla.. Whether its dry rasgulla, or flat, or the rasgulla broke into syrup, or they cracked, or they diluted into syrup or so.. :) And dont worry, even they go awry, we have solutions for them..And one can make something out or other from it..

Most of my failed attempts are due to the milk.. It has to be Pure!<br/>Sugar - Sugar quantity depends upon the pot size. The ratio of sugar water i prefer is 1:5. <br/>Chenna - It has to be dry but also should have a little amount of moisture. If the chenna is dry, rasgullas will be dry/will dilute with syrup. If it has much of moisture, rasgullas will be flat/dilute/crack.. <br/>Kneading - Follow this simple rule, knead until it starts leaving the fat/ghee! Once you feel the plate and your hands are getting greasy, make balls and cook!<br/>Rasgulla Size - You can make them smaller or big, its up to you! Ideal size if 1 inch diameter when raw. It'll be double in size when cooked!<br/>Sugar Syrup - You need atleast 4\" or more of deepness of sugar syrup in the pot you are using for making this to ensure they remain round while cooking. Pot's width should atleast be 10 inches. <br/>Sugar Syrup should be continuously boiling while they are cooking!<br/>You can clean the sugar syrup if you want crystal clear sugar syrup. To do so, add 2 tablespoon of milk to boiling sugar syrup. Remove the scum which will float in just another 10 seconds. And then cook the rasgullas.<br/>You can use any pot with a lid. Ideal size of pot for 8 rasgullas: 10 Inch Width 6-8 Inches Height! You can cook upto 10 rasgullas in this big cooker and this much syrup. But i make 8 or less to be on the safer side!<br/>Sugar syrup can be used again to make this delicacies again. Sometimes i make these in batches when making more than 10!", "title": "Bengali Sponge Rasgulla Recipe", "publish": true, "cookTime": "20 mins", "youtubeUrl": "www.youtube.com/embed/SipKS7W1Xd8", "recipeSteps": [{"group": {"steps": [{"text": "Heat milk, stirring occasionally."}, {"text": "Mix lemon juice with 2 tbsp of water.
