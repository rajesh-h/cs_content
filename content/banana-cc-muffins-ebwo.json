This recipe will make 4 Muffins in the Self Standing ones, 12 in the normal sized.<br/>Browning in Cooker : The muffins can very well brown in the cooker, but the issue is the choco-chips/walnuts at the top can burn &amp; smoke which can get awry. Don't worry, you can bake this in Medium-High flame for 20 minutes and you will get browned muffins. I have done that earlier in my trials, in my trials I used to top with choco chips and they would smoke, but it wont happen with walnuts. So feel free to bake in Med-High Flame for 20 minutes. :)<br/>Other reason I like light colored/golden ones - The brown/darker top ones have a slight firmer top and a slight not so moist inside..", "title": "Eggless Banana Choco Chip Muffins in Cooker ~ Soft and Moist | Eggless Baking Without Oven", "publish": true, "cookTime": "N/A", "youtubeUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/WzUJ7VOkJLo", "recipeSteps": [{"group": {"steps": [{"text": "Start by heating up a cooker in medium flame, add in the 1 1/2 cups of salt, a wire stand and a perforated plate.
