A comfort soup to die for. This smooth and tasty soup will keep you warm during the cold winter night, do try."}], "recipeNotes": "Notes:\nEnsure the vegetables are thinly sliced, if there are big pieces then the vegetables will sink in the soup.\nKindly use any flavorless oil in making the soup.\nDo not use iron utensil to make the soup, it will give a bad taste to the soup.\nUsing the Kashmiri Red Chili powders is optional.\nSynthetic Vinegar will complement the taste and cut down the heat.\nUse red chili sauce and red chili powder to taste.\nThe quantity of corn flour is high because the vinegar and the acidic taste of the soup will cut down the starchy thickness of the corn flour. You can replace the corn flour with maida, if you wish.\nUsing both your hands while pouring the slurry and stirring the soup is essential, because the soup is very hot and this step will ensure that the slurry is mixed well.\n", "searchTags": ["easy hot and sour soup", "hot and sour soup recipe chinese", "winter soup recipe"], "title": "Hot and Sour Soup Recipe \u2013 Indo Chinese Winter Soup \u2013 CookingShooking", "cookTime": "40 mins", "publish": true, "youtubeUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/UgeH73Pdf78?autoplay=1", "id": 8839, "recipeSteps": [{"group": {"name": "For the Stock", "steps": [{"text": "In a deep pan pour 1 \u00bd liter of water and add the vegetable peels and stalks, cover the pan and bring the water to a boil over high flame for 20 minutes.", "stepImageUrl": "https://cookingshooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Step-1-1-269x300.jpg"}, {"text": "In the meantime chop, slice, julienne and shred all the vegetables and keep aside.", "stepImageUrl": "https://cookingshooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Step-2-2-300x159.jpg"}, {"text": "After 20 minutes our stock will be ready.
