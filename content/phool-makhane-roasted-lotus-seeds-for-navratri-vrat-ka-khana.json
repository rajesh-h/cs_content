It not only cleanses us from the inside but also maintains a spiritual surrounding around us. But, as a kid to me what fantasized about being on a vrat/fast was having \"Phool makhane\" :D<br /><br />If you worry where the hell are you going to find phool makhane in the market, there are groceries which do stock them. Different names in different regions. Makhane is the common one:)<br /><br />This is something which is a must when you are fasting. And, during Navratri it is always better to stock the supplies for all the days cause you never know what snack you would like (this one is going to be a savior for all days)<br /><br />Just two ingredients, and makhane are ready :)<br /><br /></div><br />I hope you liked it!<br /><br />PS: No pictures, updating in a while or so.<br /><br />Feel free to share your pictures with us at cookingshooking(at)gmail(dot)com<br /><br />Until then, Happy CookingShooking!<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/cookingshooking\" target=\"_blank\">Do Subscribe on YouTube</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.fb.com/cookingshooking\" target=\"_blank\">Like us on FB</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/103801552676314248912/posts\" target=\"_blank\">CookingShooking is on Google+</a>", "updated": 1432896583000, "serves": "4"}
