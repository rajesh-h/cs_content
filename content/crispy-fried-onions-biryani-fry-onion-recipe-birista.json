It\u2019s non other than deep fried onion slices also known as Birista, Onions that are deep fried in oil until they are golden brown in colour and crunchy in texture. This rather simple ingredient is so vital to most of the Indian dishes that, rarely you will find anyone not using it or making it.", "imageUrl": "https://storage.googleapis.com/cscom-2019.appspot.com/uploads/2018/07/Fried-Onion.jpg"}], "searchTags": ["quick and easy"], "recipeNotes": "Notes:\nKeep stirring the onions or else they will burn from the bottom.\nSeparating the onion with a fork is an important step, because once the onions cool down they will form lumps, and it\u2019s difficult to separate them later.\nAllowing the onions to rest for an hour, helps the onions to drain excess oil and also allows the onions to cook during that time because of the heat.\n\nTips:\nStore the onion oil and use it for other dishes.\nYou can use a slicer to slice the onions if you are not comfortable to slice it with a knife.\n"}
