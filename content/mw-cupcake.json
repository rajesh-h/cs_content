These days Microwaves come with Convection Mode which is meant for baking.. Convection is nothing but Fan-Forced Baking, which means there is a fan which circulates the air inside the oven. While this is normal in High-end-OTGs,\u00a0Built in Ovens,\u00a0Gas Ranges and so on, which makes the baking happen faster and even.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F01%2Fmwcupcake8.jpg?alt=media\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2262\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F01%2Fmwcupcake8.jpg?alt=media\" alt=\"mwcupcake8\" width=\"1923\" height=\"1080\" /></a><br /><br />The scenario is somewhat different in this case, there is only one source of heat, the heating rods are either in top of the Microwave or in the sides.. Which makes the food cook faster from the top/side and slower from beneath, even with the convection/fan forced heating. Yes, this might not happen with each and every Microwave with Convection, but does happen with mine, one more i tested in, and many of you said as well. That the cake i baked in my oven was cooked from top well, but batter was wet inside. Then when i cooked it more, it was overcooked from top.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F01%2Fmwcupcake4.jpg?alt=media\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2258 aligncenter\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F01%2Fmwcupcake4.jpg?alt=media\" alt=\"mwcupcake4\" width=\"702\" height=\"1080\" /></a><br /><br />If you are successfully baking goodies in your MW then, its great! Please don't follow the excess steps mentioned just follow the recipe if you wish to :)<br /><br /><a href=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F01%2Fmwcupcake6.jpg?alt=media\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2260\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F01%2Fmwcupcake6.jpg?alt=media\" alt=\"mwcupcake6\" width=\"1923\" height=\"1080\" /></a><br /><br />Let's get into the Eggless Vanilla Cupcakes recipe :)<br /><br /><br /><br /></div><br /><br /><br /><br />Baking\u00a0is easy, if you understand your oven well.. Try to play around with it and see how it behaves, Some of my foodie friends successfully bake in their MW's Convection Mode without doing anything.. After-all it all depends upon every oven, I received a few requests for it, some also said that cake is baked but undercooked from center and so on, so did this tutorial. If you are successfully baking, no need to do this :)<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />That's all for today, Thanks for tuning in!", "updated": 1440490518000, "serves": "6 Cupcakes"}
