Just adjust it as per taste.\nUse Full fat milk, for a thicker and creamier milk.\nYou can use condensed milk or replace it with mava for much richer milk.\n", "searchTags": ["homemade how to make", "hyderabadi recipes"], "title": "Irani Chai Recipe \u2013 How to make Hyderabadi Dum Tea", "cookTime": "1 hr", "publish": true, "youtubeUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/UY0dBNCR6eA?autoplay=1", "id": 7137, "recipeSteps": [{"group": {"steps": [{"text": "Prepare soft dough with flour and water, and set aside.", "stepImageUrl": "https://cookingshooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Step-1-15-300x237.jpg"}]}}, {"group": {"name": "For the tea", "steps": [{"text": "Place a heavy bottom pot over medium heat and pour water.", "stepImageUrl": "https://cookingshooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Step-2-13-300x179.jpg"}, {"text": "Add the tea leaves, followed by the sugar or jaggery.", "stepImageUrl": "https://cookingshooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Step-3-16-218x300.jpg"}, {"text": "Cover the utensil with a tight lid and place heavy weight on top of the lid.
