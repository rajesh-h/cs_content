I would recommend to use 3.5 tbsp!<br/>Milk/Hot water: You can use either one. I prefer both. About 2-3 Tbsp Milk and rest hot water. Using only milk can produce a milk chocolate type of taste!<br/>Baking Time: It depends upon the stove.. It can take upto 45 mins.. But dont overbake.. Once the toothpick comes out clear, switch off the flame and take it out! Overbaking can result into hard cake!<br/>Usually Kirsch(Cherry Rum) is used in this cake as a syrup. We are making at home, so we'll use the cherry syrup from tin!<br/>You can use any of red cherries, black cherries, maraschino cherries.
