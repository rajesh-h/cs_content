This time, I used buttermilk(milk+vinegar) as a egg alternative in this cake and the cake came out perfect! In case, you dont get whipping cream, you can use low fat amul cream 25% for making whipped cream. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjMLzgYxWe4\">Click Me</a><br /><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0<a style=\"text-align: center;\" href=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2014%2F01%2F3.jpg?alt=media\"><img class=\" wp-image-1123 aligncenter\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2014%2F01%2F3.jpg?alt=media\" alt=\"3\" width=\"544\" height=\"478\" /></a></p><br />Lets start making the cake!<br /><br /><br /></div><br /><br />Made this cake for my neighbor, they loved it.. \u00a0You also make this and\u00a0\u00a0enjoy :)<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Until Next time, Take Care.<br /><br />Thanks, Have a great time!<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/cookingshooking\" target=\"_blank\">Do Subscribe on YouTube</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.fb.com/cookingshooking\" target=\"_blank\">Like us on FB</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/103801552676314248912/posts\" target=\"_blank\">CookingShooking is on Google+</a><br /><br />&nbsp;", "updated": 1433600572000, "serves": "N/A", "author": "Yaman Agarwal", "slug": "black-forest-cake-eggless-without-condensed-milk-without-curd", "recipeIngredients": [{"group": {"name": "", "ingredients": [{"quantity": "2 {finely chopped}", "ingredient": "Onion"}, {"ingredient": "Coconut", "quantity": "1/4 cup"}, {"quantity": "1/4 cup {roughly diced}", "ingredient": "Potato"}, {"ingredient": "Carrots", "quantity": "1/4 cup {roughly diced}"}, {"quantity": "1/4 cup {small florets}", "ingredient": "Cauliflower"}, {"quantity": "1/4 cup {chopped}", "ingredient": "Beans"}, {"quantity": "50g {cubes}", "ingredient": "Paneer"}, {"quantity": "2 tbsp + as required to shallow fry veggies", "ingredient": "Oil"}, {"quantity": "1/2 tsp", "ingredient": "Cumin Seeds"}, {"ingredient": "Asafoetida", "quantity": "1/4 tsp"}, {"ingredient": "Curry Leaves", "quantity": "4-5"}, {"quantity": "2 {slit}", "ingredient": "Green Chilis"}, {"quantity": "3 + 1", "ingredient": "Dry Red Chilis"}, {"quantity": "2", "ingredient": "Bay Leaf"}, {"quantity": "1/2 tbsp", "ingredient": "Ginger Garlic Paste"}, {"quantity": "6 Medium", "ingredient": "Blended Tomatoes"}, {"quantity": "as per taste", "ingredient": "Salt"}, {"quantity": "1 tsp", "ingredient": "Kashmiri Red Chili Powder"}, {"quantity": "1/4 tsp", "ingredient": "Black Pepper"}, {"ingredient": "Amchoor Powder", "quantity": "1 tsp"}, {"quantity": "1 tsp", "ingredient": "Garam Masala"}, {"ingredient": "Sambhar Masala", "quantity": "1 tsp"}, {"quantity": "1/4 tsp", "ingredient": "Sugar"}, {"quantity": "handful [chopped]", "ingredient": "Coriander"}, {"quantity": "1/2 tsp", "ingredient": "Corn Flour"}, {"ingredient": "Capsicum", "quantity": "1/4 cup {roughly diced}"}, {"quantity": "3 tbsp", "ingredient": "Coconut Milk"}, {"ingredient": "Tadka Garnish : Oil", "quantity": "1 tsp"}, {"quantity": "1/2 tsp", "ingredient": "Mustard Seeds"}, {"quantity": "N/A", "ingredient": "Split Bengal Gram / Chana Dal- 1/2 tsp"}, {"quantity": "N/A", "ingredient": "Split Skinless Black Gram / Dhuli Urad Dal- 1/2 tsp"}, {"quantity": "2-3", "ingredient": "Curry Leaves"}, {"quantity": "1", "ingredient": "Dry Red Chili"}, {"ingredient": "Coriander", "quantity": "1 tsp {finely chopped}"}]}}], "featuredImage": "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2014%2F01%2Fbfwcir.jpg?alt=media", "categories": [{"slug": "eggless-baking", "category": "Eggless Baking"}, {"slug": "cakes-more", "category": " Cakes & More"}], "recipeNotes": "N/A", "postTags": ["Cake", " cake in cooker", " Eggless Cake", " black", " black forest cake", " black forest cake recipe", " eggless", " food", " forest", " how", " make", " prepare", " recipe", " to", " vegetarian", " without egg", " without", " pastry", " eggs", " eggless cake without condensed milk", " Black Forest Cake (Dish)", " black forest cake recipe without eggs", " black forest cake without eggs", " condensed", " egg free", " eggless black forest cake recipe", " eggless black forest pastry recipe", " eggless cake recipe", " eggless cake using buttermilk", " milk"], "title": "Black Forest Cake, Eggless Without Condensed Milk, Without Curd", "cookTime": "N/A", "publish": true, "youtubeUrl": "www.youtube.com/embed/In_zncmp9UI", "recipeSteps": [{"group": {"name": "", "steps": [{"text": "Start by preheating oven to 180 C.
