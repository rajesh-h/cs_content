{"recipeNotes": "The restaurant I had this sabzi served it with a garnish of kurkuri beans.. Basically a fritter similar to kurkuri bhindi. You may make that, out of the 4 attempts I made at home I made the kurkuri thing thrice,, But the recipe gets more complicated and takes longer time.. So to reduce the hassle, I skipped it the fourth time, and it was still great :) If you are a person who likes eating chicken pieces in a dish with a hand, you would like the kurkuri thing in the dish.<br/>Also in the dish at the restaurant, it was loaded with black cardamons &amp; cloves.. I skipped :)<br/>You can add tamarind pulp instead of amchoor powder, I ran out of it that's why replaced with amchoor powder.", "postTags": ["Indian Cuisine (Cuisine)", " sabji", " sabzi recipes", " indian restaurant style recipes", " Main Course (Type Of Dish)", " curry recipe", " indian main course recipe", " indian main course recipes", " mili juli sabzi recipe", " mili juli sabzi recipe indian main course", " mix veg recipe", " mix veg sabzi recipe restaurant style", " recipes indian style curry", " Restaurant (Industry)", " restaurant style indian recipes", " south indian main course recipes", " veg indian recipes restaurant", " vegetable curry recipes indian"], "title": "Mili Juli Sabzi Recipe - Restaurant Style Indian Main Course Recipes", "publish": true, "cookTime": "N/A", "youtubeUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/95fmmbR86o8", "recipeSteps": [{"group": {"name": "", "steps": [{"text": "<b>Preparing Vegetables</b> : Heat up a pan, add 1 - 1 1/2 tbsp oil, followed by the carrots & potatoes.
