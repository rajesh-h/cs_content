I have tried many times in past using brown sugar, but i feel the flavor gets too strong atleast and sometimes a lil bitter as well for me &amp; my family.. Using this white sugar brings a perfect taste and flavor and is sensational.. So all comes to you and your palate, whether to use white or brown :) I'd suggest to use white :)<br /><br />Now, make some Butterscotch Cake or just top your Ice Cream with it or make or do whatever you wish for, but make sure to lick the bowl, saucepan and all ;)<br /><br />That's all for today,<br /><br />Thanks", "updated": 1440490655000, "serves": "N/A", "author": "Yaman Agarwal", "slug": "butterscotch-sauce", "recipeIngredients": [{"group": {"ingredients": [{"quantity": "2 {finely chopped}", "ingredient": "Onion"}, {"quantity": "1/4 cup", "ingredient": "Coconut"}, {"quantity": "1/4 cup {roughly diced}", "ingredient": "Potato"}, {"quantity": "1/4 cup {roughly diced}", "ingredient": "Carrots"}, {"ingredient": "Cauliflower", "quantity": "1/4 cup {small florets}"}, {"quantity": "1/4 cup {chopped}", "ingredient": "Beans"}, {"quantity": "50g {cubes}", "ingredient": "Paneer"}, {"quantity": "2 tbsp + as required to shallow fry veggies", "ingredient": "Oil"}, {"quantity": "1/2 tsp", "ingredient": "Cumin Seeds"}, {"quantity": "1/4 tsp", "ingredient": "Asafoetida"}, {"quantity": "4-5", "ingredient": "Curry Leaves"}, {"quantity": "2 {slit}", "ingredient": "Green Chilis"}, {"quantity": "3 + 1", "ingredient": "Dry Red Chilis"}, {"quantity": "2", "ingredient": "Bay Leaf"}, {"quantity": "1/2 tbsp", "ingredient": "Ginger Garlic Paste"}, {"quantity": "6 Medium", "ingredient": "Blended Tomatoes"}, {"quantity": "as per taste", "ingredient": "Salt"}, {"quantity": "1 tsp", "ingredient": "Kashmiri Red Chili Powder"}, {"ingredient": "Black Pepper", "quantity": "1/4 tsp"}, {"quantity": "1 tsp", "ingredient": "Amchoor Powder"}, {"quantity": "1 tsp", "ingredient": "Garam Masala"}, {"quantity": "1 tsp", "ingredient": "Sambhar Masala"}, {"quantity": "1/4 tsp", "ingredient": "Sugar"}, {"quantity": "handful [chopped]", "ingredient": "Coriander"}, {"quantity": "1/2 tsp", "ingredient": "Corn Flour"}, {"quantity": "1/4 cup {roughly diced}", "ingredient": "Capsicum"}, {"quantity": "3 tbsp", "ingredient": "Coconut Milk"}, {"quantity": "1 tsp", "ingredient": "Tadka Garnish : Oil"}, {"ingredient": "Mustard Seeds", "quantity": "1/2 tsp"}, {"quantity": "N/A", "ingredient": "Split Bengal Gram / Chana Dal- 1/2 tsp"}, {"quantity": "N/A", "ingredient": "Split Skinless Black Gram / Dhuli Urad Dal- 1/2 tsp"}, {"quantity": "2-3", "ingredient": "Curry Leaves"}, {"ingredient": "Dry Red Chili", "quantity": "1"}, {"quantity": "1 tsp {finely chopped}", "ingredient": "Coriander"}], "name": ""}}], "featuredImage": "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2014%2F12%2FButterscotchsauce21.jpg?alt=media", "categories": [{"slug": "basic-recipes", "category": "Basic Recipes"}, {"slug": "sauces-and-pickles", "category": " Sauces and Pickles"}], "recipeNotes": "You can use 100ml of apple juice instead of the 100ml milk.
