Basically you need a coarse besan. Bombay Besan and the Normal/Coarse Besan are the normal two kinds. Bombay Besan is a fine variety of besan, usually used in the fritters. And the coarse variety which is ground coarse, specially used for Mithais, such as this, besan ki burfi, laddo and so on. Try to find the coarse variety and use it, if unable to you could try replacing 1 1/2 tbsps of besan from 1 cup of besan with semolina/suji. Though, its best to find a coarse variety which is easily available. <br/><br/><br/>Thickness of Batter : Plays a important Role, Make sure the batter is of watery consistency. It Should Not Be Thick. If its thick, the jhara\u2019s holes may get jammed or the batter may get a little collected beneath the holes resulting in thicker/bigger boondis. On the other hand, it should not be way too diluted, it should have a like consistency. <br/><br/><br/>Consistency in Tapping : Make sure you tap/hammer your jhara\u2019s long handle in the container/stand consistently. If you do it slowly, you may get a Fried Pancake or Lumps of Boondi / Large Boondis. *DO THIS UNDER ADULT SUPERVISION IF YOU\u2019RE NOT AN ADULT LIKE I DID.* Be paitent, and don\u2019t rush there\u2019s smoky hot ghee which you\u2019re working with.<br/><br/><br/>Frying the boondis : These motichoor boondis are even smaller and a mustard and the ghee is as hot as it would smoke which means as soon as it goes to the ghee it gets cooked in a jiffy. Make sure you take them out instantly. Also make sure you let the boondis get rid of excess ghee. And time to time transfer the boondis to a bowl so that all the boondis are excess-ghee-free. <br/><br/><br/>The syrup : As soon as the sugar melts transfer to a very very low flame and add in the fried motichoor boondis. For the moti(s) to choor you need to cook them in such a way that they absorb the syrup and get soft. I presume, the mithaiwalas make in a large quantity which means the syrup cools down tremendously and then takes a good time and the boondis get cooked well and soak the syrup well. At home, you need to either switch off the flame and add the boondis and after two minutes turn it on to the lowest flame or place it in such a flame that it is close to the flame being switched off. My hob has a very small burner I used that. <br/>Cooking this mixture till such that it starts leaving sides may turn these laddos dry, which motichoors aren\u2019t. So you need to use something acidic, which will prevent the crystallization/drying of it. You can use a drop of lemon juice or citric acid or a tiny pinch of cream of tartar or as popularly known in hindi as \u201ctartari\u201d. One way of testing whether the cooking in syrup is done or not is by \u201cgrabing a boondi and pressing/trying to choor the boondi.\u201d If it choors well its ready. Note : The known texture of super soft and melt in mouth is going to come with time. The boondis of the motichoor laddo would go even softer and as found in shops as you keep it to rest, it is kinda firm when you shape it. <br/><br/><br/>The final wait : You need to either keep the mixture for quite a time like for 4-5 hours or shape the laddus then keep them for atleast 4-5 hours. This does many things; Mingles the flavors; Makes the boondies super soft and melt in mouth and just like available in market which now may be a little firm; laddos would get sweeter.", "title": "Motichoor Laddo Recipe | Perfect Motichur Laddus - Indian Sweet Secrets Revealed", "publish": true, "cookTime": "N/A", "youtubeUrl": "www.youtube.com/embed/GwroC8kFGOk", "recipeSteps": [{"group": {"name": "", "steps": [{"text": "Start by mixing the besan, a pinch of kesar food color, \u00bc tsp ghee in a bowl.
