There are many variations to making a kadhi but the basic recipe is the same, using besan, sour curd and spices. Slow cooked over low heat for almost an hour. To add some more uniqueness to the kadhi, super soft fried pakoras are also added to enhance the flavour of the kadhi. It\u2019s a healthy and extremely tasty dish. Learn how to make authentic Punjabi Kadhi Pakora right here."}], "recipeNotes": "Notes:\nUse fresh methi leaves for the pakoras, if you do not have then you can add a little of the kasoori methi\nYou can add curry patta to the second tadka.\nCooking the kadhi for longer time will bring out the best flavour in the kadhi.\n\nTips:\nCurd and besan bind together once they are boiled, so to avoid the curd from splitting we have to continuously stir.\nFrying the pakoras over high heat, then the pakoras will be raw from inside and if you fry over low heat, dues to the baking soda and dahi they will absorb more oil.\nEnsure that the kadhai cover is alsways covered \u00be away. If you cover it completely the then kadhi will spill out.\n", "searchTags": ["kadi pakoda", "punjabi kadhi pakora recipe", "punjabi recipes", "super soft pakoda for kadhi"], "title": "Kadhi Pakora Recipe \u2013 Super Soft Pakoda Punjabi Kadi \u2013 CookingShooking", "cookTime": "2 hrs", "publish": true, "youtubeUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/FBAAKMIJoNI?autoplay=1", "id": 7623}
