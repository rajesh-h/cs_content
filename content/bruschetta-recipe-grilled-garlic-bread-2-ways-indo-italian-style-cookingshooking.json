Prepare the Baguette slices by brushing olive oil; grilling it and then rubbing the slices with garlic\u2026a very important step do not skip it. Top the prepared slices with the toppings or simply bake them with cheese in an oven and you\u2019re set for the party. If you are a fan of pizzas or focaccia bread then you\u2019ll love this.
