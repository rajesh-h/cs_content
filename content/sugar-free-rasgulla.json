{"content": "Hey, Here comes another sweet recipe, but this time its sugar free. <a href=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2014%2F09%2FSFRasgulla1.jpg?alt=media\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-1943\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2014%2F09%2FSFRasgulla1.jpg?alt=media\" alt=\"SFRasgulla1\" width=\"1365\" height=\"853\" /></a> Now-a-days more and more people are not able to eat a lot of sugar.. Have been getting a lot of requests for Diabetic Friendly recipes.. So, I thought to start with this Sugar free Rasgulla.. Yes, Yes, I used Sugar Free Natura which is nothing but sucralose and having a lot of it isn't a good thing for diabetics. But I believe, having one in once in a looonnngg while doesn't matter much ya? I'm not very much known to diabetics to be true as noone in my family is diabetic.. You can use any Sucralose in this recipe.. And even cut down the sugar to half, that is add 10 grams of Sugar Free Substitute. Without any much delay, let's get on to the recipe.<br /><br /><br />Video time:<br /><br /><br /><br />Text recipe:<br /><br /></div><br /> <a href=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2014%2F09%2FSFRasgulla2.jpg?alt=media\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-1944\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2014%2F09%2FSFRasgulla2.jpg?alt=media\" alt=\"SFRasgulla2\" width=\"1229\" height=\"692\" /></a> This is a must for you to try, And I hope you will definitely try :) No compromise on anything, just tastes fantastic!<br /><p style=\"color: #777777;\">Thanks for stopping by,</p><br /><p style=\"color: #777777;\">CookingShooking is on\u00a0<a style=\"color: #428bca;\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/CookingShooking\">YouTube</a>,\u00a0<a style=\"color: #428bca;\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/CookingShooking\">Facebook</a>,\u00a0<a style=\"color: #428bca;\" href=\"https://cookingshooking.com/cabbage-sambharo/www.Google.com/+CookingshookingIn\">Google+</a>,\u00a0<a style=\"color: #428bca;\" href=\"http://twitter.com/CookingShooking\">Twitter</a>!</p>", "updated": 1433596892000, "serves": "N/A", "author": "Yaman Agarwal", "slug": "sugar-free-rasgulla", "recipeIngredients": [{"group": {"name": "", "ingredients": [{"quantity": "2 {finely chopped}", "ingredient": "Onion"}, {"quantity": "1/4 cup", "ingredient": "Coconut"}, {"quantity": "1/4 cup {roughly diced}", "ingredient": "Potato"}, {"quantity": "1/4 cup {roughly diced}", "ingredient": "Carrots"}, {"ingredient": "Cauliflower", "quantity": "1/4 cup {small florets}"}, {"quantity": "1/4 cup {chopped}", "ingredient": "Beans"}, {"quantity": "50g {cubes}", "ingredient": "Paneer"}, {"quantity": "2 tbsp + as required to shallow fry veggies", "ingredient": "Oil"}, {"quantity": "1/2 tsp", "ingredient": "Cumin Seeds"}, {"ingredient": "Asafoetida", "quantity": "1/4 tsp"}, {"ingredient": "Curry Leaves", "quantity": "4-5"}, {"quantity": "2 {slit}", "ingredient": "Green Chilis"}, {"quantity": "3 + 1", "ingredient": "Dry Red Chilis"}, {"quantity": "2", "ingredient": "Bay Leaf"}, {"quantity": "1/2 tbsp", "ingredient": "Ginger Garlic Paste"}, {"ingredient": "Blended Tomatoes", "quantity": "6 Medium"}, {"quantity": "as per taste", "ingredient": "Salt"}, {"ingredient": "Kashmiri Red Chili Powder", "quantity": "1 tsp"}, {"ingredient": "Black Pepper", "quantity": "1/4 tsp"}, {"quantity": "1 tsp", "ingredient": "Amchoor Powder"}, {"quantity": "1 tsp", "ingredient": "Garam Masala"}, {"quantity": "1 tsp", "ingredient": "Sambhar Masala"}, {"quantity": "1/4 tsp", "ingredient": "Sugar"}, {"quantity": "handful [chopped]", "ingredient": "Coriander"}, {"quantity": "1/2 tsp", "ingredient": "Corn Flour"}, {"quantity": "1/4 cup {roughly diced}", "ingredient": "Capsicum"}, {"quantity": "3 tbsp", "ingredient": "Coconut Milk"}, {"quantity": "1 tsp", "ingredient": "Tadka Garnish : Oil"}, {"quantity": "1/2 tsp", "ingredient": "Mustard Seeds"}, {"ingredient": "Split Bengal Gram / Chana Dal- 1/2 tsp", "quantity": "N/A"}, {"quantity": "N/A", "ingredient": "Split Skinless Black Gram / Dhuli Urad Dal- 1/2 tsp"}, {"ingredient": "Curry Leaves", "quantity": "2-3"}, {"ingredient": "Dry Red Chili", "quantity": "1"}, {"quantity": "1 tsp {finely chopped}", "ingredient": "Coriander"}]}}], "featuredImage": "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2014%2F09%2FSFRasgulla11.jpg?alt=media", "categories": [{"category": "Holi Special", "slug": "holi-special"}, {"slug": "indian-sweets", "category": " Indian Sweets"}, {"category": " Diwali Recipes", "slug": "diwali-recipes"}, {"slug": "traditional-halwai-recipes", "category": " Traditional Halwai Recipes"}], "recipeNotes": "I used Sugar Free Natura which comes in powder form.
