We have marinated the steamed dhokla into a delicious spicy yougurt base tandoori masala, and then tossed it in a pan. Yummy and super easy to make.

Use yellow chili powder.\nPreferably use a fine quality of besan which is also called as Bombay besan, if it\u2019s not available then use regular besan.\nRed chili paste made with red chilies, salt and oil.\n\nTips:\nPlease do not use a mixer grinder to blend the besan, use a spoon, whisk or a fork for mixing the dhokla batter.\nWhisking the batter will incorporate lot of air and this will make the dhokla fluffy. Whisking also makes the batter very fluid.\nThe dhokla batter puffs only at two stages once while whisking and second when you add the ENO.\nIf you bake the dhokla then they might dry out, hence cooking in a pan is advisable.\n", "title": "Tandoori Dhokla Recipe \u2013 Instant Spongy Nylon Khaman without ENO \u2013 CookingShooking", "publish": true, "cookTime": "15 mins", "youtubeUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/wBzjkp8yfIU?autoplay=1", "id": 8153, "recipeSteps": [{"group": {"steps": [{"text": "In a large mixing bowl pour warm water, citric acid, sugar, salt and yellow food coloring.
