There are a lot of ways making these, right from half-baking a brownie(kind batter) to imitating the lava by inserting a small piece of chocolate inside.. But when both ways takes a quite amount of time and refrigeration, guess what? Here's a super-easy method to make these in a Microwave in flat 2 minutes right from batter, to the platter! :D<br /><br /><a href=\"http://cookingshooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MW-OREO-LAVA-GIF.gif\"><img class=\" wp-image-2272 aligncenter\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2015%2F01%2FMW-OREO-LAVA-GIF.gif?alt=media\" alt=\"MW OREO LAVA GIF\" width=\"895\" height=\"504\" /></a><br /><br />Inserting a piece of chocolate bar won't melt well in a minute's worth of time also chocolate needs more of agitation, now as you can't agitate a cake whilst cooking so I came up with this method.. Making frozen chocolate ganache balls and filling the lava cakes with it.. Also this recipe does not need any flour, just a couple of oeros, some sugar and milk and a tiny bit of baking powder along with our frozen chocolate balls..
