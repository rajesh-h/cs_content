So you can make homemade choco chips by using compound chocolate.\nBoth ways of baking are the same, just the baking time, temperature and the shape is a little different.\n\nTips:\nUse a big cooker which has height and which can accommodate the size of your baking tray this will ensure even cooking and the cookies get the brown colour on top.\nYou can use butter paper, foil or\u00a0parchment paper to line the baking trays.\nIf we do not break the round dome shape on top of the cookie, then the cookie will be baked in round shape and the cookies won\u2019t be crunchy.
