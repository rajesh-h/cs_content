Just as you like it!"}], "recipeNotes": "Notes:\nDo not proceed to make the bread if the yeast mixture is not frothy, or else your bread will not proof.\nMilk powder will make the bread very soft and tender.\nUse a cooker which has height and which can accommodate the size of your bread tin. This will ensure even cooking.\nIf you do not have a round ring you can use a wired stand, katori, cookie cutter or a bowl to elevate the height.\nUse a serrated knife to slice the bread, do to not use the regular knife.\n\nTips:\nNever add salt directly to the yeast mixture it will kill the yeast and will not activate.\nTo make good dough your dough needs to have lots of moisture and it has to be very soft, almost paste like.\nBrushing the bread with milk, will ensure that you get the brown colour on top. Milk has natural fat and sugar which helps in the browning. You can also use sweet water.\nIf the bread is under risen it will crack and over risen then it will deflate.\nLow flame means, more cooking time and dry bread and High flame means, less cooking time and very moist bread.\n", "searchTags": ["bread recipe in cooker", "bread without oven", "how to make bread without oven"]}
