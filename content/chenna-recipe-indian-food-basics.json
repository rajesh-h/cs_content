Then add the lemon juice to curdle. This will make sure that you get soft chenna. <br/>You can use citric acid or vinegar in place of lemon. But lemon works best!!<br/>For making rasgullas, moisture content of the chenna is the main key.. if its wet, they can mix with syrup if very dry they can come out dry.. So make sure to hand it for 1 hour or more and let the chenna moisture drain on its own.<br/>Whey: Guys, trust me this is very versatile.. Dont throw it at all. <br/>Use it as veg stock it any dish, and see the magic. i prefer in sambhar, it takes it to another level.<br/>Make ur pizza, chapati, naan, bread or any kind of dough using this.. <br/>Use this to make Kadhi. <br/>Drink it, its proteinous.<br/>Keep it in counter for 3-4 days that'll make it even sour. Then curdle the milk again using this for even softer chenna.<br/>In all there are many many uses of this whey..
