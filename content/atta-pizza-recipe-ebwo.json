Whole Wheat Crust or Atta Pizza is the one most of us look for.. So days back, i was returning from Mumbai and one of our foodie friend recognized me, i mean she watches our recipes and likes them a lot.. So we were talking about food ofcourse, the conversation came to pizzas and she said, now-a-days we dont even touch normal base, we get multigrain or whole wheat base only. It would be great if you could tell me how to make atta pizza at home.. Finally, here it is.. And not only she but many of you have requested me this, so.. :)<br /><br /><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-1658\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2014%2F05%2F13.jpg?alt=media\" alt=\"1\" width=\"997\" height=\"561\" /><br /><br /><br /></div><br /><br />Healthy, Cheesy, Yummy, Scrumptious and you cannot just stop eating this :D<br /><br />Watch the video recipe:<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><p style=\"color: #777777;\">That\u2019s it for today!</p><br /><p style=\"color: #777777;\">Hope to hear from you soon\u00a0<img src=\"https://cookingshooking.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" /></p><br /><p style=\"color: #777777;\">Thanks for stopping by,</p><br /><p style=\"color: #777777;\">CookingShooking is on\u00a0<a style=\"color: #428bca;\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/CookingShooking\">YouTube</a>,\u00a0<a style=\"color: #428bca;\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/CookingShooking\">Facebook</a>,\u00a0<a style=\"color: #428bca;\" href=\"https://cookingshooking.com/cabbage-sambharo/www.Google.com/+CookingshookingIn\">Google+</a>,\u00a0<a style=\"color: #428bca;\" href=\"http://twitter.com/CookingShooking\">Twitter</a>!</p>", "updated": 1433598478000, "serves": "N/A", "slug": "atta-pizza-recipe-ebwo", "author": "Yaman Agarwal", "recipeIngredients": [{"group": {"ingredients": [{"quantity": "2 {finely chopped}", "ingredient": "Onion"}, {"quantity": "1/4 cup", "ingredient": "Coconut"}, {"ingredient": "Potato", "quantity": "1/4 cup {roughly diced}"}, {"quantity": "1/4 cup {roughly diced}", "ingredient": "Carrots"}, {"quantity": "1/4 cup {small florets}", "ingredient": "Cauliflower"}, {"quantity": "1/4 cup {chopped}", "ingredient": "Beans"}, {"quantity": "50g {cubes}", "ingredient": "Paneer"}, {"quantity": "2 tbsp + as required to shallow fry veggies", "ingredient": "Oil"}, {"quantity": "1/2 tsp", "ingredient": "Cumin Seeds"}, {"ingredient": "Asafoetida", "quantity": "1/4 tsp"}, {"quantity": "4-5", "ingredient": "Curry Leaves"}, {"quantity": "2 {slit}", "ingredient": "Green Chilis"}, {"ingredient": "Dry Red Chilis", "quantity": "3 + 1"}, {"quantity": "2", "ingredient": "Bay Leaf"}, {"quantity": "1/2 tbsp", "ingredient": "Ginger Garlic Paste"}, {"quantity": "6 Medium", "ingredient": "Blended Tomatoes"}, {"ingredient": "Salt", "quantity": "as per taste"}, {"ingredient": "Kashmiri Red Chili Powder", "quantity": "1 tsp"}, {"quantity": "1/4 tsp", "ingredient": "Black Pepper"}, {"quantity": "1 tsp", "ingredient": "Amchoor Powder"}, {"ingredient": "Garam Masala", "quantity": "1 tsp"}, {"ingredient": "Sambhar Masala", "quantity": "1 tsp"}, {"quantity": "1/4 tsp", "ingredient": "Sugar"}, {"ingredient": "Coriander", "quantity": "handful [chopped]"}, {"quantity": "1/2 tsp", "ingredient": "Corn Flour"}, {"ingredient": "Capsicum", "quantity": "1/4 cup {roughly diced}"}, {"ingredient": "Coconut Milk", "quantity": "3 tbsp"}, {"quantity": "1 tsp", "ingredient": "Tadka Garnish : Oil"}, {"ingredient": "Mustard Seeds", "quantity": "1/2 tsp"}, {"quantity": "N/A", "ingredient": "Split Bengal Gram / Chana Dal- 1/2 tsp"}, {"quantity": "N/A", "ingredient": "Split Skinless Black Gram / Dhuli Urad Dal- 1/2 tsp"}, {"quantity": "2-3", "ingredient": "Curry Leaves"}, {"quantity": "1", "ingredient": "Dry Red Chili"}, {"quantity": "1 tsp {finely chopped}", "ingredient": "Coriander"}], "name": ""}}], "featuredImage": "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2014%2F05%2Fattapizzair.jpg?alt=media"}
