You can replace the peppermint to peppermint candy like polo.\nAvoid using the watery liquid from the gulkand, only use the solid part.\nWhile shaping the paan, hold the paan tightly.\nA double boiler is nothing but heating a vessel on top of another vessel which has water in it.\nYou can prepare the paans beforehand and keep it in the fridge and they can stay upto 24 hours. Remember to keep it covered with a damp cloth.\n", "title": "Chocolate Paan Recipe \u2013 Choco Meetha Pan Indian Street Food \u2013 CookingShooking", "publish": true, "cookTime": null, "youtubeUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/fk0Q-O7zy0U?autoplay=1", "id": 8655, "recipeSteps": [{"group": {"steps": [{"stepImageUrl": "https://cookingshooking.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Step-1-4-177x300.jpg", "text": "Begin by snipping the stem and washing and trimming the sides of the paan leaves to the size of your palm."}, {"text": "Apply some hazelnut paste on top of each leaves and then place one piece of the trimmed paan leaves over it.
