This warm and soft gulab jamun literally melts in mouth, and one forgets the count of how many they've had eaten. And, this is the best part, cause\u00a0when we buy stuff from the sweet shop vendors we do love it but somewhere, we do feel it is not so great to eat a whole lot of gulab jamuns or any other sweet in abundance.<br /><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a style=\"text-align: center;\" href=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2013%2F09%2F5.jpg?alt=media\"><img class=\" wp-image-714 aligncenter\" src=\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/cscom-2019.appspot.com/o/content%2F2013%2F09%2F5.jpg?alt=media\" alt=\"5\" width=\"784\" height=\"614\" /></a></p><br />Simple ingredients and heavenly taste!<br /><br />Heres the Mawa recipe: <a title=\"Click Me!!!\" href=\"https://cookingshooking.com/mawa-khoya/\" target=\"_blank\">https://cookingshooking.com/mawa-khoya/</a><br />Chenna is here: <a title=\"Click Me!!!\" href=\"https://cookingshooking.com/chenna-recipe-indian-food-basics/\" target=\"_blank\">https://cookingshooking.com/chenna-recipe-indian-food-basics/</a><br /><br /></div><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />I would love to hear you in the comments section below.<br /><br />Don't forget to subscribe me on my youtube channel for video recipes. <a title=\"Click Me!!!\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQun_zHZFbU\" target=\"_blank\">(I have a giveaway going on on my youtube channel which ends on October 10, so make sure you put up your entry.
