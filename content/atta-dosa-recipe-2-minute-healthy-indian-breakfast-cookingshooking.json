Medium flame is ideal for a perfect dosa.\n", "searchTags": ["2 minute breakfast recipe", "healthy recipes for weight loss", "instant dosa batter", "wheat dosa recipe"], "title": "Atta Dosa Recipe \u2013 2 Minute Healthy Indian Breakfast \u2013 CookingShooking", "cookTime": "2 mins", "publish": true, "youtubeUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kqq83sOMFsU?autoplay=1", "id": 8418, "recipeSteps": [{"group": {"steps": [{"text": "In a large mixing bowl combine atta, salt and eno.
