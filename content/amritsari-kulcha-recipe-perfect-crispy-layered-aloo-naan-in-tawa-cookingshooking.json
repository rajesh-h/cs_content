Important step please do not skip it. Quantity of butter is upto you.\nThe quantity of the kulcha depends on the size of the dough you make.\nThe uneven thickness gives you the best results in a kulcha.\nPlease do not use a non-stick tava to make the kulcha.\nOnce you have placed the coriander, apply some water, this will ensure that the kulcha cooks slowly and give crispy results.\n\nTips:\nWhen we make a naan the flame has to be high and when we make a kulcha the flame has to be low.\nCrushing the kulcha will open up the layers.
